# SoilSavy
This project leverages MiniCPM-V 2.0 to develop an AI-powered system for plant health assessment and crop recommendation. It integrates image-based disease detection and deficiency analysis to provide actionable insights for farmers, enabling smarter decision-making in agriculture.

Key Features
✅ Plant Disease Detection – Uses AI to identify plant diseases from images.
✅ Deficiency Analysis – Detects nutrient deficiencies and suggests corrective measures.
✅ Crop Recommendation – Provides optimal crop suggestions based on soil and environmental conditions.
✅ Real-time Insights – Helps farmers make informed decisions for better yield and sustainability.

How It Works
1️⃣ Upload a plant image for analysis.
2️⃣ The AI model detects diseases, deficiencies, and health status.
3️⃣ The system provides recommendations for treatment and best-suited crops.

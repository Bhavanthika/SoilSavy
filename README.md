# SoilSavy
This project utilizes MiniCPM-V 2.0 to develop an AI-driven system for plant health assessment and crop recommendation. By integrating image-based disease detection and deficiency analysis, it provides actionable insights for farmers, enabling smarter and more sustainable agricultural decision-making.

The system offers:
Plant Disease Detection – AI-based identification of plant diseases from images.
Deficiency Analysis – Detection of nutrient deficiencies with corrective recommendations.
Crop Recommendation – Optimal crop suggestions based on soil and environmental factors.
Real-time Insights – Actionable guidance to enhance yield and sustainability.
How It Works
1️⃣ Upload a plant image for analysis.
2️⃣ The AI model detects diseases, nutrient deficiencies, and overall health status.
3️⃣ The system provides treatment recommendations and suggests the best-suited crops.
